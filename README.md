# No Name Project

At some point this will be a python web application (Flask) with a SQL database (sqlite3). I have no idea what this is going to be yet, and I hope to figure it out along the way. 

Here's the first few things I'm gonna do, in no particular order:

* Set up the virtual env
* Get the app to listen for requests on "/"
* Build a home page
* Create a DB with a Users table
* Build a login form with validation
* Build a registration form with validation
